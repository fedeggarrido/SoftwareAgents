# Context usage gauge

### Context usage (server/src/contextUsage.ts)

Every agent's context gauge. Fed from `message.usage` on assistant records by `processTranscriptLine`, broadcast as `agentContextUsage` and rendered by `ToolOverlay`.

- **Snapshot, not a total.** Context = the newest turn's `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + output_tokens`. Summing turns measures spend, not occupancy, and misses the cached tokens that ARE the context (`input_tokens` is single digits once caching kicks in). Falls on compaction and `/clear` for free.
- **All-zero usage means "no news"** — synthetic records (API errors, interrupts) report zeros and must not blank the gauge.
- **Sidechain rule**: a lead's sidechain records are its sub-agents' turns and must not move its gauge; a teammate's own transcript is sidechain top to bottom and would otherwise never report. Positional latch (`sawMainChainUsage`): once a file produces a main-chain turn, later sidechain records belong to someone else.
- **The window comes from the provider**, not from the runtime: `HookProvider.contextWindowForModel(model)` (Claude: 1M for the current line, 200k for Haiku and the older models, `undefined` for ids it can't place). Transcripts state usage but never the limit, and guessing 200k for a 1M model reads five times too full. `widenContextWindow` is the backstop for unrecognized models and unknown-larger windows — it only ever widens, since a context that doesn't fit disproves the assumption while a shrinking one proves nothing.
- **`seedContextUsage` runs once per agent in `startFileWatching`** — the single seam every watched agent passes through. Agents adopted or restored mid-session start at end-of-file, so without a tail read they'd have no gauge until their next turn.
- Sub-agents get no gauge: no session of their own, and the shadow store never forwards `agentContextUsage`.
