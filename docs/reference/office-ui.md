## Office UI

**Rendering**: Game state in imperative `OfficeState` class (not React state). Pixel-perfect: zoom = integer device-pixels-per-sprite-pixel (1x–10x). No `ctx.scale(dpr)`. Default zoom = `Math.round(2 * devicePixelRatio)`. Z-sort all entities by Y. Pan via middle-mouse drag (`panRef`). **Camera follow**: `cameraFollowId` (separate from `selectedAgentId`) smoothly centers camera on the followed agent; set on agent click, cleared on deselection or manual pan.

**UI styling**: Pixel art aesthetic — sharp corners (`borderRadius: 0`), solid backgrounds (`#1e1e2e`), `2px solid` borders, hard offset shadows (`2px 2px 0px #0a0a14`, no blur). CSS variables in `index.css` `:root` (`--pixel-bg`, `--pixel-border`, `--pixel-accent`, ...). Pixel font: FS Pixel Sans (`webview-ui/src/fonts/`), loaded via `@font-face`, applied globally.

Custom ESLint rules (`eslint-rules/pixel-agents-rules.mjs`) enforce: `no-inline-colors` (hex/rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla literals only in `constants.ts`), `pixel-shadow` (must use `var(--pixel-shadow)` or `2px 2px 0px`), `pixel-font` (must reference FS Pixel Sans). All `error`-level — they block PRs.

**Characters**: FSM states — active (pathfind to seat, typing/reading animation by tool type), idle (wander randomly with BFS, return to seat after `wanderLimit` moves). 4-directional sprites, left = flipped right. Tool animations: typing (Write/Edit/Bash/Task) vs reading (Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch). Sitting offset: characters shift down 6 px in TYPE state. Z-sort uses `ch.y + TILE_SIZE/2 + 0.5` so characters render in front of same-row furniture but behind lower-row furniture. **Chair z-sorting**: non-back chairs use `zY = (row+1)*TILE_SIZE` (capped to first row); back-facing chairs use `zY = (row+1)*TILE_SIZE + 1` so the chair back renders in front of the character. Chair tiles are blocked for all characters except their own assigned seat (per-character pathfinding via `withOwnSeatUnblocked`).

**Diverse palette assignment**: `pickDiversePalette()` counts palettes of current non-sub-agent characters; picks randomly from least-used palette(s). First 6 agents each get a unique skin; beyond 6, skins repeat with a random hue shift (45–315°) via `adjustSprite()`. Character stores `palette` (0-5) + `hueShift` (degrees). Sprite cache keyed by `"palette:hueShift"`.

**Spawn/despawn effect**: Matrix-style digital rain animation (0.3 s). 16 vertical columns sweep top-to-bottom with staggered timing. Spawn: green rain reveals character pixels. Despawn: character pixels consumed by green rain trails. `matrixEffect` field on Character (`'spawn'`/`'despawn'`/`null`). Normal FSM is paused during effect. Restored agents (`existingAgents`) use `skipSpawnEffect: true` to appear instantly.

**Sub-agents**: Negative IDs (from -1 down). Created on `agentToolStart` with "Subtask:" prefix, or lazily by `subagentToolStart` when missing (watched background spawns, post-reload recreation). Same palette + hueShift as parent. Click focuses parent terminal. Not persisted. Spawn at the closest free walkable tile to the parent (`closestFreeWalkableTile`) — around it, never in a seat. Idle (stop typing) when every tracked sub-tool row is done; overlay shows the latest non-done sub-tool status, falling back to the Subtask label.

**Speech bubbles**: Permission ("..." amber dots) stays until clicked/cleared. Waiting (green checkmark) auto-fades 2 s. Sprites in `spriteData.ts`.

**Sound notifications**: Ascending two-note chime (E5 → E6) via Web Audio API plays when waiting bubble appears (`agentStatus: 'waiting'`). `notificationSound.ts` manages AudioContext lifecycle; `unlockAudio()` on canvas mousedown resumes the context (webviews start suspended). Toggled via Settings modal. Persisted per-namespace in `~/.pixel-agents/config.json`.

**Seats**: Derived from chair furniture. `layoutToSeats()` creates a seat at every footprint tile of every chair. Multi-tile chairs produce multiple seats keyed `uid` / `uid:1` / `uid:2`. Facing direction priority: 1) chair `orientation` from catalog (front→DOWN, back→UP, left→LEFT, right→RIGHT), 2) adjacent desk direction, 3) forward (DOWN). Click character → select (white outline) → click available seat → reassign.

## Layout Editor

Toggle via "Layout" button. Tools: SELECT (default), Floor paint, Wall paint, Erase (set tiles to VOID), Furniture place, Furniture pick (eyedropper for furniture type), Eyedropper (floor).

**Floor**: 7 patterns from `floors.png` (grayscale 16×16), colorizable via HSBC sliders (Photoshop Colorize). Color baked per-tile on paint. Eyedropper picks pattern+color.

**Walls**: Separate Wall paint tool. Click/drag to add walls; click/drag existing walls to remove (toggle direction set by first tile of drag, tracked by `wallDragAdding`). HSBC color sliders (Colorize mode) apply to all wall tiles at once. Eyedropper on a wall tile picks its color and switches to Wall tool. Furniture cannot be placed on wall tiles, but background rows may overlap walls.

**Furniture**: Ghost preview (green/red validity). R key rotates, T key toggles on/off state. Drag-to-move in SELECT. Delete button (red X) + rotate button (blue arrow) on selected items. Any selected furniture shows HSBC color sliders (Color toggle + Clear button); color stored per-item in `PlacedFurniture.color?`. Single undo entry per color-editing session (tracked by `colorEditUidRef`). Pick tool copies type+color from placed item. Surface items preferred when clicking stacked furniture.

**Undo/Redo**: 50-level, Ctrl+Z/Y. EditActionBar (top-center when dirty): Undo, Redo, Save, Reset.

**Multi-stage Esc**: exit furniture pick → deselect catalog → close tool tab → deselect furniture → close editor.

**Erase tool**: Sets tiles to `TileType.VOID` (transparent, non-walkable, no furniture). Right-click in floor/wall/erase tools also erases to VOID (drag-erasing supported). Context menu suppressed in edit mode.

**Grid expansion**: In floor/wall/erase tools, a ghost border (dashed outline) appears 1 tile outside the grid. Clicking a ghost tile calls `expandLayout()` to grow the grid by 1 tile in that direction. New tiles are VOID. Furniture positions and character positions shift when expanding left/up. Max: `MAX_COLS`×`MAX_ROWS` (64×64). Default: `DEFAULT_COLS`×`DEFAULT_ROWS` (20×11). Characters outside bounds after resize relocated to random walkable tiles.

**Layout model**: `{ version: 1, cols, rows, tiles: TileType[], furniture: PlacedFurniture[], tileColors?: ColorValue[] }`. Grid dimensions are dynamic. Persisted via debounced saveLayout message → `writeLayoutToFile()` → `~/.pixel-agents/layout.json`.

## Asset System

**Loading**: `esbuild.js` copies `webview-ui/public/assets/` → `dist/assets/`. Loader checks bundled path first, falls back to workspace root. PNG → pngjs → SpriteData (2D hex array, alpha≥2 = visible, `#RRGGBBAA` for semi-transparent). `loadDefaultLayout()` reads `assets/default-layout.json` as fallback for new workspaces.

**Catalog**: `furniture-catalog.json` with `id, name, label, category, footprint, isDesk, canPlaceOnWalls, groupId?, orientation?, state?, canPlaceOnSurfaces?, backgroundTiles?`. String-based type system. Categories: desks, chairs, storage, electronics, decor, wall, misc. Wall-placeable items use the `wall` category and appear in a dedicated "Wall" tab. Asset naming convention: `{BASE}[_{ORIENTATION}][_{STATE}]` (e.g., `MONITOR_FRONT_OFF`).

**Per-furniture manifests**: Each furniture item lives in its own folder under `assets/furniture/` with a `manifest.json` that declares its sprites, rotation groups, state groups (on/off), and animation frames. Floor tiles are individual PNGs in `assets/floors/`; wall tile sets in `assets/walls/`.

**Rotation groups**: `buildDynamicCatalog()` builds `rotationGroups` Map from assets sharing a `groupId`. Supports 2+ orientations (e.g., front/back only). Editor palette shows 1 item per group (front orientation preferred). `getRotatedType()` cycles through available orientations.

**State groups**: Items with `state: "on"` / `"off"` sharing the same `groupId` + `orientation` form toggle pairs. `stateGroups` Map enables `getToggledType()` lookup. Editor palette hides on-state variants. State groups are mirrored across orientations.

**Auto-state**: `officeState.rebuildFurnitureInstances()` swaps electronics to ON sprites when an active agent faces a desk with that item nearby (3 tiles deep in facing direction, 1 tile to each side). Operates at render time without modifying the saved layout.

**Background tiles**: `backgroundTiles?: number` — top N footprint rows allow other furniture to be placed on them AND characters to walk through. Z-sort places bg-row items behind the host furniture.

**Surface placement**: `canPlaceOnSurfaces?: boolean` — items like laptops, monitors, mugs can overlap with all tiles of `isDesk` furniture. `canPlaceFurniture()` builds a desk-tile set and excludes it from collision checks. Z-sort: surface items get `zY = max(spriteBottom, deskZY + 0.5)`.

**Wall placement**: `canPlaceOnWalls?: boolean` — items like paintings, windows, clocks can only be placed on wall tiles. `canPlaceFurniture()` requires the bottom row of the footprint to be on wall tiles; upper rows may extend above the map. `getWallPlacementRow()` offsets placement so the bottom row aligns with the hovered tile.

**Colorize module**: `colorize.ts` with two modes selected by `ColorValue.colorize?` flag. **Colorize mode** (Photoshop-style): grayscale → luminance → contrast → brightness → fixed HSL; always used for floor tiles. **Adjust mode** (default for furniture and character hue shifts): shifts original pixel HSL. `adjustSprite()` exported for character hue shifts. Cache keyed by arbitrary string (includes colorize flag).

**Floor tiles**: `floors.png` (112×16, 7 patterns). Cached by (pattern, h, s, b, c).

**Wall tiles**: `walls.png` (64×128, 4×4 grid of 16×32 pieces). 4-bit auto-tile bitmask (N=1, E=2, S=4, W=8). Sprites extend 16 px above tile (3D face). `wallTiles.ts` computes bitmask at render time. Colorizable via HSBC sliders. Wall sprites z-sorted with furniture/characters (`getWallInstances()` builds `FurnitureInstance[]`).

**Character sprites**: 6 pre-colored PNGs (`assets/characters/char_0.png`–`char_5.png`), one per palette. Each 112×96: 7 frames × 16 px wide, 3 direction rows × 32 px tall. Row 0 = down, Row 1 = up, Row 2 = right. Frame order: walk1, walk2, walk3, type1, type2, read1, read2. Left = flipped right at runtime. When `hueShift !== 0`, `hueShiftSprites()` applies `adjustSprite()` to all frames before caching.

**Load order**: `characterSpritesLoaded` → `floorTilesLoaded` → `wallTilesLoaded` → `furnitureAssetsLoaded` → `layoutLoaded`.
